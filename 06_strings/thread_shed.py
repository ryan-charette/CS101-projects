#Youâ€™ve recently been hired as a cashier at the local sewing hobby shop, Thread Shed. 
#Some of your daily responsibilities involve tallying the number of sales during the day, calculating the total amount of money made, and keeping track of the names of the customers.
#Unfortunately, the Thread Shed has an extremely outdated register system and stores all of the transaction information in one huge unwieldy string called daily_sales.
#All day, for each transaction, the name of the customer, amount spent, types of thread purchased, and the date of sale is all recorded in this same string. 
#Your task is to use your Python skills to iterate through this string and clean up each transaction and store all the information in easier-to-access lists.
